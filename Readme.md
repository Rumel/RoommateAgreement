The existence of a long distance relationship between a roommate and the select pursued female shall be aided by the opposite party unless the said party and at least five, but no more than then ten people chosen equally by each party vote that the afore mentioned female is a bitch. (On a side note, this voting system is known as the Without The Female (WTF) Vote)
